updates and cleanup.

All environment Variables prefixed with SERVER, are the available enshrouded_server.json options (

⚠️: Work in Progress

### Game Version Updates

During automatic updates you need about double the storage to house the update files.

### Additional Information

* STEAM_API_KEY is only needed for the update cron, to check if the server is empty. You can get a key from
  [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). If not supplied, the check will be skipped.

### Hooks

| Variable           | Description                            | WIP |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|:---:|
| `BOOTSTRAP_HOOK`   | Command to run after generel bootstrap | ⚠️  |
| `UPDATE_POST_HOOK` | Command to run after update            | ⚠️  |

The scripts will wait for the hook to resolve/return before continuing.

## Ports (default)

| Port      | Description      |
|-----------|------------------|
| 15636/udp | Game port        |
| 15637/udp | Steam query port |

## Volumes

| Volume          | Description                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| /opt/enshrouded | Game files (steam download path) |

**Note:** By default the volumes are created with the UID and GID 4711 (that user should not exist). To change this, set
the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID`.

## Recommended System Requirements

[Official Docs](https://enshrouded.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16055628734109-Recommended-Server-Specifications)

## Usage

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name enshrouded \
  --hostname enshrouded \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  -p 15636-15637:15636-15637/udp \
  -v ./game:/opt/enshrouded \
  -e SERVER_NAME="Enshrouded Server" \
  -e SERVER_PASSWORD="secret" \
  -e UPDATE_CRON="*/30 * * * *" \
  -e PUID=4711 \
  -e PGID=4711 \
  mornedhels/enshrouded-server:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  enshrouded:
    image: mornedhels/enshrouded-server:latest
    container_name: enshrouded
    hostname: enshrouded
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 90s
    ports:
      - "15636-15637:15636-15637/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./game:/opt/enshrouded
    environment:
      - SERVER_NAME=Enshrouded Server
      - SERVER_PASSWORD=secret
      - UPDATE_CRON=*/30 * * * *
      - PUID=4711
      - PGID=4711
```

**Note:** The volumes are created next to the docker-compose.yml file. If you want to create the volumes, in the default
location (eg. /var/lib/docker) you can use the following compose file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  enshrouded:
    image: mornedhels/enshrouded-server:latest
    container_name: enshrouded
    hostname: enshrouded
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 90s
    ports:
      - "15636-15637:15636-15637/udp"
    volumes:
      - game:/opt/enshrouded
    environment:
      - SERVER_NAME=Enshrouded Server
      - SERVER_PASSWORD=secret
      - UPDATE_CRON=*/30 * * * *
      - PUID=4711
      - PGID=4711

volumes:
  game:
```

## Commands

* **Force Update:**
  ```bash
  docker compose exec enshrouded supervisorctl start enshrouded-force-update
  ```

## Known Issues

* The server doesn't start (not logging `'HostOnline' (up)!`) or the update fails with following error:
  ```
  Error! App '2278520' state is 0x202 after update job.
  ```
  This means there is probably something wrong with your file permissions. Make sure the UID and GID are correct and the
  files are owned by the correct user.
